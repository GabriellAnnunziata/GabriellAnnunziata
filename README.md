## Hi, my name is Gabriella 

I am an Italian chemical engineering student and over the past year, I have been delving into the field of application development, where my exploration has encompassed both the realms of design and code, with a particular emphasis on the latter.
Iâ€™m driven by the curiosity to comprehend individuals and appreciate their inherent worth, this serves as an impetus to consistently deliver my utmost in a team environment. Moreover, it propelled me towards venturing into the domain of project management, blending my academic foundation with my insatiable quest for exploration.
